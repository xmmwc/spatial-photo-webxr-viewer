# Apple Spatial Photo WebXR Viewer

[**Try it here.**](https://zfox23.github.io/spatial-photo-webxr-viewer) Spatial photos are processed locally and never leave your device.

With the launch of the iPhone 16 Pro, more phones than ever before are now capable of capturing 3D photographs. Apple calls these "Spatial Photos".

This small Web application allows you to view these spatial photos in 3D VR using WebXR.

## Why?

Spatial photography and spatial audio capture are untapped tools for human connection and recollection. This is mainly because experiencing spatial computing is still cumbersome and socially isolating, requiring use of expensive, uncomfortable headsets.

But those limitations are slowly disappearing, and XR technology is more accessible than it's ever been. As more people experience *meaningful* spatial content, more people are going to want to be able to capture and view that content.

I don't think Apple Spatial Photos should only be viewable on Apple devices. So, I built this viewer!

## Multidimensional Memories

Apple's hardware isn't yet capable of producing the truly immersive spatial content. For that, the photo's field of view must be wider, and the photos must be paired with spatial audio.

For the past few years, I have been experimenting with a new media format I'm calling "Multidimensional Memories". MDMs are wide-angle (180Â°) photographs paired with 30-second spatial audio clips.
